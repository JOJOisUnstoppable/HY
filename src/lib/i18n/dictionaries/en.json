          "title": "Gas Pressure",
          "desc": "A sealed cylinder contains compressed nitrogen gas. When a force is applied to the rod, the gas is further compressed, creating a counterforce that resists the movement, providing support or cushioning."
        },
        "step2": {
          "title": "Force Transmission & Balance",
          "desc": "The pressure difference between the gas in the cylinder and the external environment generates a linear force on the piston. This force is transmitted through the rod, enabling controlled lifting, lowering, or positioning of loads. The damping mechanism regulates the speed of movement."
        },
        "step3": {
          "title": "Locking & Control",
          "desc": "Lockable gas springs use a valve or mechanical mechanism to trap gas in the cylinder, locking the rod in a fixed position. Release mechanisms (levers, buttons) allow the gas to flow freely again, enabling repositioning."

          "Free-type gas springs have only two end positions (fully extended/retracted) with no locking in between, while lockable ones can be fixed at any point in their stroke using a locking mechanism.",
          "Calculate based on the load weight, installation angle, and desired movement (lifting, lowering, supporting). It's recommended to select a force 1.2-1.5 times the calculated required force for safety.",
          "Depends on cycle frequency, operating temperature, load magnitude, and environmental conditions (dust, moisture). High-quality springs typically last 50,000+ cycles under normal use.",
          "Most gas springs are designed for specific installation orientations (e.g., rod up/down). Incorrect installation can reduce performance and lifespan; refer to product specifications.",
          "Extreme temperatures affect gas pressure: low temps reduce force, high temps increase it. Special formulations are available for extreme temperature ranges (-40°C to 120°C).",
          "Keep clean, avoid damage to the rod surface, and ensure proper mounting. Do not disassemble or puncture the cylinder, as it contains high-pressure gas."
